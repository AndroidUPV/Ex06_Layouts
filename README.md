Different buttons provide access to a an activity that displays the selected type of layout:
- Vertical LinearLayout: Positions Views one below another.
- Horizontal LinearLayout: Positions Views one after another (left to right).
- Nested layout: Layouts can be nested to accommodate Views as desired. In this case it combines vertical and horizontal LinearLayouts.
- RelativeLayout (old): Positions Views with respect to their parent (layout) and the other Views. The more modern ConstraintLayout is recommended instead.
- ConstraintLayout (recommended instead of RelativeLayout): Positions Views with respect to their parent (layout) and the other Views.
- FrameLayout: Holds just one View.
- TableLayout: Holds TableRows that position Views one after another (left to right).
- Gridlayout: Holds Views within a grid pattern (rows and columns).
